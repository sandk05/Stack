# Balanced Brackets

A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].
Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the
left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs
of brackets: [], {}, and ().
A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For
example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. The pair of
square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a
single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].

By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met:
- It contains no unmatched brackets.
- The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched
pair of brackets.

Given **_n_** strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is
balanced, return YES. Otherwise, return NO.

**Function Description**
Complete the function _isBalanced_ in the editor below. It must return a string: YES if the sequence is
balanced or NO if it is not.

isBalanced has the following parameter(s):
- _s_: a string of brackets

**Input Format**

The first line contains a single integer **_n_**, the number of strings.
Each of the next **_n_** lines contains a single string **_s_**, a sequence of brackets.

**Constraints**
- **1 <= _n_ <= 10 <sup>3</sup>**
- **1 <= |_s_| <= 10 <sup>3</sup>**, where **|_s_|**  is the length of the sequence.
- All chracters in the sequences âˆˆ { **{** , **}** , **(** , **)** , **[** , **]** }.

**Output Format**
For each string, return YES or NO.

**Sample Input**
```
3
{[()]}
{[(])}
{{[[(())]]}}
```
**Sample Output**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

**Explanation**
1. The string {[()]} meets both criteria for being a balanced string, so we print YES on a new line.
2. The string {[(])} is not balanced because the brackets enclosed by the matched pair { and } are
not balanced: [(]).
3. The string {{[[(())]]}} meets both criteria for being a balanced string, so we print YES on a new line.
